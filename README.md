Source code for the website http://rough-copies.com, which is the digital platform where I publish all my work and research done on lucid dreaming. It also contains the information and documentation for the dreaming device / software that I have created that plays sound triggers when the program detects the user to be in a REM sleep cycle, aka in a dream state.
