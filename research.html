		<p>With preliminary tests and researching done with the MindWave and programming I've written, I have isolated and documented an incident where I was conciously affecting delta wave amplitudes, by keeping their wavelengths low for the short periods of time which I meditated myself into a certain mood. This mood was similar in feeling to how becoming lucid in a dream felt, as I was tired and sleep-deprived, and was able to induce myself in and out of a dream-like trance.</p><br>
		<br>
		<p>Go to the Meditations / Dreams page to see the gallery of snapshots taken of affecting delta waves through meditation. The last snapshots in the gallery demonstrate the mood affecting delta waves for a period of 30 seconds to a minute.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>As more research is done and more progress on the devices / program are made, the findings will be carefully documented and published on these pages, so check back later if you're interested!</p>
